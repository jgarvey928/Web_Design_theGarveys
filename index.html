        <p> The Garvey family came from Ireland and has lived in Massachusetts since around 1860. Michael and his two children
            Nancy and William were the first generation to immegrate to America. William was nearly thirty years old when he arrived
            and was immediately drafed into the civil war and serverd in the 4th Battery of the Massachusetts Light Artillery. Later on, William's
            grandson and my gradfather John would marry Ruth Long in Springflied, Massachusetts and have two sons and one daughter.
            In the early 1980s, Dennis son of John and Ruth, my father, meets Geralyn Studley, daughter of Merl and Dorothy, at Cape Code
            Community College. Dennis and Gerry had two kids a daughter Maggie and a son John Garvey, me.

        <h3>- Goals -</h3>
        <p> The goal of this website is to create an virtual archive for the history of the Garvey family. First, to trace the 
            lineage of the surname Garvey that led to my birth. Next to illustrate the Garvey lineage in a family tree. Finally, to 
            archive old photos of my life and then even older photos of the family going back several generations.
