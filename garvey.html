        <h2>- Garvey History -</h2>
        <p>The following section is devoted to a history of the Garvey lineage. This page follows the male lineage
            of the name Garvey that leads all the way to me. The trail starts at the last generation to live in 
            Ireland being Michael. Michael along with his two children Nancy and William left Ireland for America around 1860.
            William was nearly thirty years old by the time he came to America and was immediately drafted into the civil war. 
            William survives and goes on to marry Mary Casey and together they had five children which were the first to be born in America. 
            All of whom are buried at Saint John's Cemetery in Worcester, Massachusetts and can be found at
            <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100264310/william-garvey">findagrave.com</a></p>.
